Homework problem for software engineering class

Problem 2.2.4 â€” Date-time group
Write a program that takes command line input on a console written as a single string of characters representing a date-time group. The program should accept the following format:
YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS (Year/Month/Day/T/Hour/Minute/Second).
55 For example, the following represents January 18, 1998, at 11 PM: 19980118T230000

After reading the input string, the program should use the input value to create a JavaScript Date
objects and print it out as is commonly used in the United States, such as:

January 18, 1998, at 11 PM

The program should run in a loop, accept the input value and print the output. The solution should include extensive Jasmine test cases, particularly for edge cases (described in Section 1.1.3)
